Feature: display list of movies filtered by MPAA rating
 
  As a concerned parent
  So that I can quickly browse movies appropriate for my family
  I want to see movies matching only certain MPAA ratings

Background: movies have been added to database

  Given the following movies exist:
  | title                   | rating | release_date |
  | Aladdin                 | G      | 25-Nov-1992  |
  | The Terminator          | R      | 26-Oct-1984  |
  | When Harry Met Sally    | R      | 21-Jul-1989  |
  | The Help                | PG-13  | 10-Aug-2011  |
  | Chocolat                | PG-13  | 5-Jan-2001   |
  | Amelie                  | R      | 25-Apr-2001  |
  | 2001: A Space Odyssey   | G      | 6-Apr-1968   |
  | The Incredibles         | PG     | 5-Nov-2004   |

  | Chicken Run             | G      | 21-Jun-2000  |

  And  I am on the RottenPotatoes home page
  
Scenario: 

  When I follow "Movie Title"
  Then I should see "Aladdin" before "Amelie"
  When I check the following ratings: G R
  And I uncheck the following ratings: PG PG-13
  When I follow "More about Amelie"
  #Then I should be on Amelie page
  When I follow "Back to movie list"
  #Then I should be on the RottenPotatoes home page
